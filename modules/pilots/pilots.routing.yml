# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function or method will
# be called when a URL is accessed. The following lines defines three of them
# for this module.
# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# page_example.links.menu.yml file.
# If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=examples/page-example, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\pilots\Controller\WeightPageController") and a method
# ("weightPage").

# Access to this path is not restricted. This is notated as _access: 'TRUE'.
